    "While for developer velocity it is preferable to use Workspace to run python scripts, for automation and launching jobs from your laptop without having to spin up a Workspace it is recommended to run the fine-tuning workloads via isolated [Anyscale jobs](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/jobs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to specify the command that needs to run (ex. [COMMAND][ARGS]) along with the requirements (ex. docker image, additional, pip packages, etc.) in a job yaml and then call `anyscale job submit` to launch the job on Anyscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Executing an Anyscale Job within a Workspace will ensure that files in the current working directory are available for the Job (unless excluded with --exclude). But we can also load files from anywhere (ex. Github repo, S3, etc.) if we want to launch a Job from anywhere."

    "\n",
    "- `entrypoint` is basically the command we want to run. Pay attention to the relative file location (config/llama-3-8b.yaml) and the `working_dir`. Inside `llama-3-8b.yaml` we are also referencing a relative path to `config/zero_3_offload_optim+param.json` which works because of specifying the `working_dir` to be the current dir `.`.\n",
    "- `image_uri` refers to the image that has llmforge installed. On a the finetuning template the latest released image is automatically listed. For the full list of versions and their uris visit [llmforge versions](../../README.md#llmforge-versions). If you run this job from a workspace the image_uri will be inherited from the workspace image.\n",
    "- `max_retries`: setting this to zero makes sure we do not keep retrying if the job fails. We should retry only when the job is flaky (maybe due to resource constraints, etc.)\n",
    "- `working_dir`: Setting working_dir to current dir is necessary when you are submitting this job from outside of workspace (Your laptop or CI/CD pipelines)"
