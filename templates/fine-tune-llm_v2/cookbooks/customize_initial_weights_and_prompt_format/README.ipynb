    "# Bring your own weights\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on how you can bring your own weights while fine-tuning. In general, you can customize the initial weights in your fine-tuning run through two options in the YAML:\n",
    "- `initial_base_model_ckpt_path` : Path to the base model weights you wish to start with\n",
    "- `initial_adapter_model_ckpt_path`: Path to the adapter (LoRA) weights you wish to start with\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bring models of the same architecture\n",
    "You can fine-tune a model similar in architecture to the Llama or Mistral family of models to fine-tune on the Anyscale Platform. For example, to fine-tune Llama Guard 2, you can \n",
    "specify the model ID and `initial_base_model_ckpt_path` as below:\n",
    "### Example YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "model_id: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B\n",
    "initial_base_model_ckpt_path: s3://my-bucket/llama-guard-2\n",
    "train_path: s3://air-example-data/gsm8k/train.jsonl\n",
    "valid_path: s3://air-example-data/gsm8k/test.jsonl\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching idea is that specifying a model ID will provide context to the architecture of the LLM, which will guide how the model will be further trained. It won't necessarily mean that the model that is specified here is the model that will be fine-tuned. For that, we will rely on the weights that are provided. Knowing that Llama 3 8B model (or any other Llama model for that matter) shares the same architecture as the Llama Guard 2 model makes it a suitable choice for the model ID. However, note that this would still use the same chat-templating / prompt formatting as Llama-3 while starting to fine-tune with Llama Guard 2 weights. For the specific case of Llama Guard 2, we need customization even in the prompt format which will be outlined below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I configure access to my weights in remote storage?\n",
    "\n",
    "For models configured for public access, you simply need to add the URI of the location of the model weights in your training YAML. We support loading models stored on S3 (with GCS support coming soon). For private models, you could configure the read permissions for your Workspace to pull from the bucket holding your model weights. Alternatively, you could sync your model weights to your Anyscale-provided artifact storage, or even just keep it in shared storage in your workspace. The [Bring your own data](../../cookbooks/bring_your_own_data/README.md) cookbook, while focusing on datasets, provides in-depth detail on these options.\n"

    "# Customizing the prompt format\n",
    "\n",
    "## How prompt formatting works in `llmforge`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick rundown of how prompt formatting/ chat templating works right now: the training/validation data needs to be formatted in the OpenAI messages format. Each example has a \"messages\" entry consisting a conversation with \"system\", \"user\" and \"assistant\" roles. For each role, depending on the model, we add certain tokens as headers/footers along with a BOS token at the start of the conversation and an EOS token at the end of each assistant response. The prompt format can be specified in our YAML as a part of the `generation_config` for the model (the same format is used in our inference code):\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",
    "  prompt_format:\n",
    "    system: \n",
    "    user: \n",
    "    assistant:\n",
    "    bos: # optional\n",
    "    system_in_user: # optional\n",
    "    trailing_assistant:  # optional, inference-only\n",
    "    default_system_message: # optional\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "For `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B`, we use the following prompt format:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",
    "  prompt_format:\n",
    "    system: \"\"\"\"<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n{instruction}<|eot_id|>\"\"\"\"\n",
    "    user: \"\"\"<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n{instruction}<|eot_id|>\"\"\"\n",
    "    assistant: \"\"\"<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n{instruction}<|eot_id|>\"\"\"\n",
    "    bos: \"\"\"<|begin_of_text|>\"\"\" \n",
    "    system_in_user: False\n",
    "    trailing_assistant: \"\"\"<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"\"\" # inference-only \n",
    "    default_system_message: \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For `mistralai/Mistral-7B`, we the below prompt format:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",
    "  prompt_format:\n",
    "    system: \"\"\"\"{instruction} + \"\"\"\"\n",
    "    user: \"\"\"[INST] {system}{instruction} [/INST]\"\"\"\n",
    "    assistant: \"\"\" {instruction}</s>\"\"\"\n",
    "    bos: \"\"\"<s>\"\"\" \n",
    "    system_in_user: True\n",
    "    trailing_assistant: \"\" # inference-only \n",
    "    default_system_message: \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information on each entry in the [config API reference](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/finetuning-config-api). Each `system`, `user` and `asistant` entry must contain the format specifier `{instruction}` which will actually format the corresponding entry in `messages`. For example, if a `messages` entry was as follows while training Llama-3-8B:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json \n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"messages\": [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant\"}, \n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the value of 1+1?\"}, \n",
    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The value is 2\"}\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The formatted text input to the model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou are a helpful assistant<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat's the value of 1+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThe value is 2<|eot_id|>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Different LLMs are trained with different prompt formats (or chat templates). In order to figure out the right way to format your data and choose the config parameters, we need to work backwords from the text input we desire. For Llama Guard 2, for instance, the format that the model is trained with is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "<|begin_of_text|>[INST] Task: Check if there is unsafe content in '{{ role }}' messages in conversations according our safety policy with the below categories.\n",
    "<BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "{{ unsafe_categories }}\n",
    "<END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "<BEGIN CONVERSATION>\n",
    "User: {{ user_message_1 }}\n",
    "Agent: {{ model_answer_1 }}\n",
    "<END CONVERSATION>\n",
    "Provide your safety assessment for ONLY THE LAST {{ role }} in the above conversation:\n",
    "- First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.\n",
    "- If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated list of violated categories. [/INST]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is wildly different from Llama-3's prompt format. Fortunately, the OpenAI conversation format is highly flexible and adaptable to almost any input. In a case like Llama Guard 2, it is beneficial to take control of the templating yourself and format your inputs beforehand in the data preprocessing stage. For example, here's one way your data can look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"system\": \"<|begin_of_text|>[INST] Task: Check if there is unsafe content in '{{ role }}' messages in conversations according our safety policy with the below categories.\n",
    "<BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "{{ unsafe_categories }}\n",
    "<END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "<BEGIN CONVERSATION>\n",
    "User: {{ user_message_1 }}\n",
    "Agent: {{ model_answer_1 }}\n",
    "<END CONVERSATION>\n",
    "Provide your safety assessment for ONLY THE LAST {{ role }} in the above conversation:\n",
    "- First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.\n",
    "- If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated list of violated categories. [/INST]\", \n",
    "\"user\": \"\", \n",
    "\"assistant\": \"{expected_response}\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we've taken care of the full templating ourselves, we just need the prompt formatter to verbatim concatenate the content in different roles. Thus, the generation config can look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",
    "  prompt_format:\n",
    "    system: \"\"\"{instruction}\"\"\"\n",
    "    user: \"\"\"{instruction}\"\"\"\n",
    "    assistant: \"\"\"{instruction}\"\"\"\n",
    "    bos: \"\" # optional, empty string by default\n",
    "    trailing_assistant: \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above example, the \"instruction\" passed in to the `system` template is simply the entire prompt, the \"instruction\" passed in to the `user` template is empty, and the \"instruction\" passed in to the `assistant` is the expected response ('safe' or 'unsafe'). Also note that we've specified only one of the many possibilites of `prompt_format` you can specify (with your data preprocessing changing accordingly).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the change in the base model weights (`initial_base_model_ckpt_path`) and the change in `prompt_format`, you should be able to fine-tunea model like Llama Guard-2."
