    "**‚è±Ô∏è Time to complete**: N/A\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning LLMs is an easy and cost-effective way to tailor their capabilities towards niche applications with high-acccuracy. While Ray and RayTrain offer a generic primitives for building such workloads, at Anyscale we have created a higher-level library called _LLMForge_ that builds on top of Ray and other open-source libraries to provide an easy to work with interface for fine-tuning and training LLMs. \n",

    "## What is LLMForge?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMForge is a library that implements a collection of design patterns that use Ray, RayTrain, and RayData in combination with other open-source libraries (e.g. Deepspeed, ü§ó Huggingface accelerate, transformers, etc.) to provide an easy to use library for fine-tuning LLMs. In addition to these design patterns, it offers tight integrations with the Anyscale platform, such as model registery, streamlined deployment, observability, Anyscale's job submission, etc."

    "### Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMForge workloads are specified using YAML configurations ([documentation here](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/finetuning-config-api)). The library offers two main modes: `auto` and `custom`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auto Mode\n",
    "Similar to OpenAI's finetuning experience, the `auto` mode provides a minimal and efficient setup. It allows you to quickly start a finetuning job by setting just a few parameters (`model_id` and `train_path`). All other settings are optional and will be automatically selected based on dataset statistics and predefined configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Mode\n",
    "The `custom` mode offers more flexibility and control over the finetuning process, allowing for advanced optimizations and customizations. You need to provide more configurations to setup this mode (e.g. prompt format, hardware, batch size, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a comparison of the two modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Auto Mode | Custom Mode |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Ideal For | Prototyping what's possible, focusing on dataset cleaning, finetuning, and evaluation pipeline | Optimizing model quality by controlling more parameters, hardware control |\n",
    "| Command | `llmforge anyscale finetune config.yaml --auto` | `llmforge anyscale finetune config.yaml` |\n",
    "| Model Support | Popular chat-format models (e.g., `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`) | Any HuggingFace model, any format (e.g., `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-Guard-2-8B`) |\n",
    "| Task Support | Instruction tuning for multi-turn chat | CausalLM, instruction tuning, classification, preference tuning |\n",
    "| Data Format | Fixed for chat-style data | Flexible, supports various prompt formats |\n",
    "| Hardware | Automatically selected (limited by availability) | User-configurable |\n",
    "| Fine-tuning type| Only supports LoRA (Rank-8, all linear layers) | User-defined LoRA and Full-parameter |\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the mode that best fits your project requirements and level of customization needed."
