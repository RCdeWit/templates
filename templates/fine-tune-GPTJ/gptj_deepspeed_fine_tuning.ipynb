    "\n",
    "We can now configure Ray AIR's `ray.train.huggingface.TransformersTrainer` to perform distributed fine-tuning of the model. In order to do that, we specify a `trainer_init_per_worker` function, which creates a ðŸ¤— Transformers `Trainer` that will be distributed by Ray using Distributed Data Parallelism (using PyTorch Distributed backend internally). This means that each worker will have its own copy of the model, but operate on different data, At the end of each step, all the workers will sync gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GPT-J is a relatively large model, it may not be possible to fit it on smaller GPU types (<=16 GB GRAM). To deal with that issue, we can use [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed), a library to optimize the training process and allow us to (among other things) offload and partition optimizer and parameter states, reducing GRAM usage. Furthermore, DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 allows us to load large models without running out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ¤— Transformers and Ray AIR's integration allow you to easily configure and use DDP and DeepSpeed. All you need to do is specify the DeepSpeed configuration in the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "There are many DeepSpeed settings that allow you to trade-off speed for memory usage. The settings used below are tailored to the cluster setup used (16 g4dn.4xlarge nodes) and per device batch size of 16. Some things to keep in mind:\n",
    "- If your GPUs support bfloat16, use that instead of float16 mixed precision to get better performance and prevent overflows. Replace `fp16=True` with `bf16=True` in `TrainingArguments`.\n",
    "- If you are running out of GRAM: try reducing batch size (defined in the cell below the next one), set `\"overlap_comm\": False` in DeepSpeed config.\n",
    "- If you are running out of RAM, add more nodes to your cluster, use nodes with more RAM, set `\"pin_memory\": False` in the DeepSpeed config, reduce the batch size, and remove `\"offload_param\"` from the DeepSpeed config.\n",

By changing the number of workers, we can change the **effective batch size** and thus the time needed for training to complete. The effective batch size is then calculated as `per device batch size * number of workers * number of gradient accumulation steps`. As we add more workers, the effective batch size rises and thus we need less time to complete a full epoch. While the speedup is not exactly linear due to extra communication overheads, in many cases it can be close to linear.\n",
