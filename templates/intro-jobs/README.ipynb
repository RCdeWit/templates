    "Typically, we recommend running batch Ray apps as Anyscale Jobs when moving to production. Like workspaces, Anyscale Jobs run with their own Ray cluster, so you can run the exact same Ray program in a workspace as a Job too.\n",

    "**Note**: Ray also has an internal concept of a \"Ray job\", which is created when running a Ray app. Anyscale Jobs, Workspaces, and Services all launch Ray jobs internally."
