# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I add a new model?

The easiest way is to copy the configuration of the existing model's YAML file and modify it. See models/README.md for more details.

## How do I deploy multiple models at once?

You can append another application configuration to the YAML in `serve.yaml` file. Alternatively, you can use the CLI linked above.

## How do I deploy a model to multiple nodes?

All our default model configurations enforce a model to be deployed on one node for high performance. However, you can easily change this if you want to deploy a model across nodes for lower cost or GPU availability. In order to do that, go to the YAML file in the model registry and change `placement_strategy` to `PACK` instead of `STRICT_PACK`.

## How can I configure the resources / instances being used or the scaling behavior of my service?

You can edit the Compute Configuration direclty on your Workspace.  [Compute configurations](https://docs.anyscale.com/configure/compute-configs/overview) define the shape of the cluster and what resources Anyscale will use to deploy models and serve traffic.  If you would like to edit the default compute configuration choose "Edit" on your workspace and update the configuration.  When moving to production and deploying as an Ansycale Service the new configuration will be used.

Note that certain models require special accelerators.  Be aware that updating the resources make cause issues with your application.  

## My deployment isn't starting/working correctly, how can I debug?

There can be several reasons for the deployment not starting or not working correctly. Here are some things to check:
1. You might have specified an invalid model id.
2. Your model may require resources that are not available on the cluster. A common issue is that the model requires Ray custom resources (eg. `accelerator_type_a10`) in order to be scheduled on the right node type, while your cluster is missing those custom resources. You can either modify the model configuration to remove those custom resources or better yet, add them to the node configuration of your Ray cluster. You can debug this issue by looking at Ray Autoscaler logs ([monitor.log](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/user-guides/configure-logging.html#system-component-logs)).
3. Your model is a gated Hugging Face model (eg. meta-llama). In that case, you need to set the `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable cluster-wide. You can do that either in the Ray cluster configuration or by setting it before running `serve run`.
4. Your model may be running out of memory. You can usually spot this issue by looking for keywords related to "CUDA", "memory" and "NCCL" in the replica logs or `serve run` output. In that case, consider reducing the `max_batch_prefill_tokens` and `max_batch_total_tokens` (if applicable). See models/README.md for more information on those parameters.

In general, [Ray Dashboard](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/monitoring.html#ray-dashboard) is a useful debugging tool, letting you monitor your application and access Ray logs.
