## My deployment isn't starting/working correctly, how can I debug?

There can be several reasons for the deployment not starting or not working correctly. Here are some things to check:
1. You might have specified an invalid model id.
2. Your model may require resources that are not available on the cluster. A common issue is that the model requires Ray custom resources (eg. `accelerator_type_a10`) in order to be scheduled on the right node type, while your cluster is missing those custom resources. You can either modify the model configuration to remove those custom resources or better yet, add them to the node configuration of your Ray cluster. You can debug this issue by looking at Ray Autoscaler logs ([monitor.log](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/user-guides/configure-logging.html#system-component-logs)).
3. Your model is a gated Hugging Face model (eg. meta-llama). In that case, you need to set the `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable cluster-wide. You can do that either in the Ray cluster configuration or by setting it before running `serve run`.
4. Your model may be running out of memory. You can usually spot this issue by looking for keywords related to "CUDA", "memory" and "NCCL" in the replica logs or `serve run` output. In that case, consider reducing the `max_batch_prefill_tokens` and `max_batch_total_tokens` (if applicable). See models/README.md for more information on those parameters.

In general, [Ray Dashboard](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/monitoring.html#ray-dashboard) is a useful debugging tool, letting you monitor your application and access Ray logs.
