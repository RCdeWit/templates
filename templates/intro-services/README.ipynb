    "\n",
    "When scaling your service, it is important to understand the interaction of the Serve scaling config (i.e., contents of `@serve.deployment`), vs the Ray cluster config (i.e., number of Ray worker nodes). In general, you can think of the Ray cluster config as an upper bound on service scaling, since Ray Serve runs inside the Ray cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the Ray cluster was configured to have at most 100 CPUs, then Serve would only be able to launch up to 100 replicas, no matter the deployment config.\n",

    "For this reason, we generally recommend using the \"Auto-select machines\" cluster config for services (this is the default).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Editing service cluster config\n",
    "\n",
    "When a service is first created, it will copy the cluster config from the workspace. After that, the service cluster config is decoupled from the workspace and can be edited independently."
